# Why this project?

As we move into an mobile era, Small Business lacks a 'portal' to reach their customers on mobile devices. Sure, we have websites, but they don't 'capture' the customers once they leave the website.

This demo represents a solution for such problem: a demo app, which connects to existing WordPress website, to display news for the business. So that the owner can keep posting news on webiste, and it will be fetched to mobile over the air.
